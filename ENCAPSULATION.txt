  {object_name}_{class_name}__variable_name = value
  
#Nothing in python is truly private

For accessing the private instance variable we can make the get method and set method
In this way we do not give access to the user to use private variable 
and Now we can controll the type and value of private instance variable
So int this way we are making getter and setter for every data member 
this is called Encapsulation
These are function inside the Encapsulation
   Make private attributes
   getter and setter method
