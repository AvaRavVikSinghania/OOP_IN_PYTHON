#instance variable
  All the variable created inside the constructor called instance variable
  Reason is that these variable have different different value according to the data instance
  How to make the instance variable private __variable_name and method name we can private __method_name()
  How to access private instance
  {object_name}_{class_name}__variable_name = value
  
#Nothing in python is truly private

For accessing the private instance variable we can make the get method and set method
In this way we do not give access to the user to use private variable 
and Now we can controll the type and value of private instance variable
So int this way we are making getter and setter for every data member 
this is called Encapsulation
These are function inside the Encapsulation
   Make private attributes
   getter and setter method



reference variable
pass by reference

class object are also mutable like lists ,dict and set
immutable object


instance variable => it is a variable which value is different for every object
Ex IFSC CODE
Static variable : it is variable which value is same for every object
instance variable : different for every object

How to access these two variable
for instance variable self.variable_name
for Static variable class_name.variable_name

To make Static function we do not need self (object)  because we do not need 
So define it we write @staticmethod before the function
we need static method when we deal with static variable
